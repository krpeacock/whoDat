###A minimal social network

This is partially a resource that I wanted for myself, but it also seems like a good opportunity to open up a project for a bunch of us to contribute to. 

###What do?

Fill an empty tile with your information and link to a profile picture in the images folder. Use my tile as a template. 

Make sure to add this repo as a remote so that your fork stays up to date.

Once your information is up, make sure your tile is in alphabetical order. The "search bar" at the top does nothing, but ctrl + f should suffice for now. 

###Updating the website
For the moment, I'll have to handle the merge requests and manually update the web server. Hopefully soon I'll have a better solution.
